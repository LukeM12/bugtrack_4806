# bugtrack_4806
This bug tracker will allow users to track their bugs and keep track of how they are doing on their milestones.


Description

This project will be for a bug hunting app that adds a game element to tracking and resolving bugs. The app will have heavy integration with the github API so that bugs will be retrieved and and documented on github throught the app. In addition to the integration with github the app will add certain game elements to the process of bug resolving by having bugs with start and expiry times. These bugs, if completed before expiry, award the solver a certain amount of points that will be displayed on a leaderboard and may have some internal value within the company to encousrage people to hunt these bugs. these bugs will not be tracked by our app at any point they will all be made/resolved using the github API.
